# Flowim-prototype
The first prototype and implementation of my programming language, Flowim

> **Please note:** This repository is only a prototype of the Flowim programming language and has only a small amount of features. The official version of the programming language is still in development and will be released soon (?).

## Prerequisites
You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your device.

## Usage
Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install the required node modules, including [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Run `npm start` to start a REPL where you can begin evaluating statements and expressions!

To run code in a `.flwm` file, use `run(<filepath>)`, for example: `run('examples/helloworld.flwm')`. You can find a small list of code examples in the [examples](examples) folder.

## Documentation
See the [docs](docs) folder for documentation on the prototype. Note that the documentation and grammar is not final and is subject to change in the main version of the language.
