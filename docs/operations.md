# Operations
The following is a list of all binary and unary **operations** supported in this prototype:

## Arithmetic
Arithmetic operations follow the order of operations:
| Symbol | Binary Operation |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| `+`    | Addition         |
| `-`    | Subtraction      |
| `*`    | Multiplication   |
| `/`    | Division         |
| `%`    | Modulus          |
| `^`    | Exponentiation   |

| Symbol | Unary Operation |
| ------ | --------------- |
| `-`    | Negation        |

## Comparison
| Symbol | Binary Operation         |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| `==`   | Equal to                 |
| `!=`   | Not equal to             |
| `<`    | Less than                |
| `>`    | Greater than             |
| `<=`   | Less than or equal to    |
| `>=`   | Greater than or equal to |

| Keyword | Binary Operation                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `or`    | `true` if any condition is true    |
| `and`   | `true` if both conditions are true |

| Keyword | Unary Operation                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `not`   | Invert a condition                 |

## Other
| Symbol | Binary Operation |
